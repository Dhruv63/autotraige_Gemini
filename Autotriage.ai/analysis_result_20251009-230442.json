  "summary": "The customer is experiencing repeated software installation failures at the 75% mark, with no specific error message provided beyond \"Installation failed.\" The agent is attempting to gather more information about the error.",
  "extracted_issue": "The main technical issue is **an unknown error occurring during software installation, specifically stopping at the 75% completion mark.** The error message is uninformative (\"Installation failed\" with no further details), making troubleshooting difficult.",
  "suggested_solution": "Here's a step-by-step solution to troubleshoot the unknown installation error at 75%:\n\n*   **Step 1: Restart and Retry Installation**\n    *   Completely close the installer.\n    *   Restart your computer.\n    *   Attempt the installation again. Sometimes, temporary system glitches can cause such errors.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check System Requirements**\n    *   Verify that your computer meets all the minimum and recommended system requirements for the software you are trying to install (e.g., operating system version, RAM, disk space, processor speed).\n    *   Ensure your system is up-to-date with the latest operating system service packs and updates.\n\n*   **Step 3: Download a Fresh Copy of the Installer**\n    *   The installer file itself might be corrupted.\n    *   Delete the current downloaded installer.\n    *   Download the installer again from the official source, ensuring a stable internet connection during the download.\n\n*   **Step 4: Run the Installer as Administrator**\n    *   Right-click on the installer file.\n    *   Select \"Run as administrator\" from the context menu. This provides the installer with the necessary permissions to modify system files.\n\n*   **Step 5: Check for Conflicting Software**\n    *   Antivirus software, firewalls, or other security programs can sometimes interfere with installations.\n    *   Temporarily disable your antivirus and firewall (remember to re-enable them after the installation attempt).\n    *   Close any unnecessary background applications that might be consuming system resources or conflicting with the installation process.\n\n*   **Step 6: Free Up Disk Space**\n    *   Insufficient disk space is a common cause of installation failures, especially when nearing completion.\n    *   Check the available disk space on the drive where you are installing the software. Ensure there is significantly more space than the software's reported installation size.\n    *   Delete unnecessary files or uninstall unused programs to free up space.\n\n*   **Step 7: Inspect Installation Logs (If Available)**\n    *   Many software installers generate log files that can provide more detailed error information.\n    *   Check common log file locations for the software or the operating system. These can often be found in:\n        *   `C:\\Program Files\\YourSoftwareName\\` (or `Program Files (x86)`)\n        *   `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`\n        *   `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\`\n        *   Specific log directories mentioned in the software's documentation.\n    *   Look for files with extensions like `.log`, `.txt`, or `.err`. Review these logs for any specific error codes or messages that appear around the 75% completion mark.\n\n*   **Step 8: Perform a Clean Boot**\n    *   A clean boot starts Windows with a minimal set of startup programs and drivers, helping to isolate software conflicts.\n    *   Search for \"msconfig\" in the Windows search bar and open \"System Configuration.\"\n    *   On the \"Services\" tab, check \"Hide all Microsoft services,\" then click \"Disable all.\"\n    *   On the \"Startup\" tab, click \"Open Task Manager.\" Disable all startup items in Task Manager.\n    *   Restart your computer and try the installation again. Remember to re-enable all services and startup items afterward.\n\n*   **Step 9: Check for Operating System Corruptions**\n    *   System file corruption can sometimes lead to installation issues.\n    *   Open Command Prompt as administrator.\n    *   Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter. This command scans for and repairs corrupted Windows system files.\n    *   Once the scan is complete, restart your computer and try the installation.\n\n*   **Step 10: Seek Specific Software Support**\n    *   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, the problem is likely specific to the software you're installing.\n    *   Consult the software's official documentation, knowledge base, or support forums.\n    *   Search online for the specific error message (even if it's vague) along with the software name and version. Others may have encountered and solved the same problem.\n    *   If necessary, contact the software vendor's technical support directly, providing them with all the troubleshooting steps you've already taken.",
