  "suggested_solution": "Here's a step-by-step solution to troubleshoot a software installation failing at 75% with a generic error:\n\n**Initial Assessment & Information Gathering:**\n\n*   **Note the exact software name and version:** This is crucial for searching for known issues.\n*   **Note the operating system and version:** (e.g., Windows 10 Pro, macOS Ventura 13.5, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).\n*   **Note any other software running during installation:** Sometimes, conflicts arise with other applications.\n*   **Check system requirements:** Ensure your system meets or exceeds the software's minimum and recommended requirements.\n*   **Review installation logs (if available):**\n    *   **Windows:** Look for files ending in `.log`, `.txt`, or `.msi` in temporary directories (`%TEMP%` or `C:\\Windows\\Temp`), or within the software's installation folder if it created one before failing. You can often find the installer's log file by searching the registry or using specific command-line flags during re-installation.\n    *   **macOS:** Check the `Console.app` for relevant error messages during the installation period.\n    *   **Linux:** Look in `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, or specific installer logs (e.g., `.deb` or `.rpm` logs).\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n*   **Restart the computer:** This is the simplest yet often effective first step to clear temporary glitches.\n*   **Run the installer as administrator (Windows/Linux) or with elevated privileges (macOS):** This grants the installer the necessary permissions to modify system files and directories.\n*   **Temporarily disable Antivirus/Firewall software:** Antivirus programs can sometimes mistakenly identify legitimate installation files as threats and block their execution. **Remember to re-enable them after the installation attempt.**\n*   **Download a fresh copy of the installer:** The original download might be corrupted. Try downloading the installer again from the official source.\n*   **Check for pending Windows/macOS/Linux updates:** Ensure your operating system is fully up-to-date. Sometimes, missing OS components can cause installation failures.\n*   **Free up disk space:** Ensure you have significantly more free disk space than the software's installation size. Installations often require temporary space during the process.\n*   **Clean up temporary files:** Use the built-in Disk Cleanup tool (Windows) or manually delete temporary files from `/tmp` (Linux/macOS).\n*   **Perform a clean boot (Windows):** This starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, helping to identify software conflicts. Search for \"msconfig\" in the Windows search bar and follow the steps for a clean boot.\n*   **Uninstall previous versions (if applicable):** If you're upgrading or reinstalling, ensure any previous versions or remnants of the software are completely removed. Use the \"Add or Remove Programs\" (Windows) or the software's uninstaller, and then manually check for leftover files and registry entries.\n*   **Try installing in Safe Mode (Windows):** This boots Windows with only essential drivers and services, minimizing the chance of conflicts.\n*   **Check for specific error codes (if any appear after re-running):** If re-running the installer (perhaps with logging enabled) reveals any specific error codes (e.g., \"Error 0x80070005 Access is denied\"), search for solutions related to that specific code.\n*   **Search for known issues with the specific software:**\n    *   Visit the software vendor's website for a knowledge base, FAQs, or forums.\n    *   Perform web searches using the software name, version, and the observed failure point (e.g., \"Software X v1.2 installation fails at 75%\").\n\n**Advanced Troubleshooting (If the above doesn't work):**\n\n*   **Run a System File Checker (SFC) scan (Windows):** Open Command Prompt as administrator and run `sfc /scannow`. This checks for and repairs corrupted Windows system files.\n*   **Use the Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter (Windows):** This tool can help fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed.\n*   **Manually delete leftover files/folders from previous failed attempts:** Navigate to the likely installation directory and any temporary locations where the installer might have extracted files and manually delete them (use caution and back up if unsure).\n*   **Consult the software vendor's support:** If you've exhausted all other options, contact the software's technical support team. Provide them with all the information you've gathered, including your system details, the exact error message, and the steps you've already tried.\n\n**Once resolved, remember to:**\n\n*   **Re-enable your Antivirus/Firewall.**\n*   **Restart your computer** to ensure all changes are applied.",
